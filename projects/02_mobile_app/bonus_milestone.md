# Bonus Milestone - Design a Custom Feature for User Engagement

> Bonus Milestones are optional. They are an extra challenge if you are finished and satisfied with the previous milestones of your project. 

### What you will do:

In this bonus milestone, you will have the opportunity to design a custom feature aimed at enhancing user engagement within the meditation app. This feature could be anything from a daily reminder system, a progress tracker, or a social sharing option that allows users to share their meditation achievements with friends. The goal is to create a feature that encourages regular use and deepens the user's connection with the app.

### You will learn more about:

You will develop skills in designing user-centered features that enhance engagement and retention. This milestone will help you understand how to think creatively and strategically about feature development, ensuring that the new functionality aligns with user needs and business goals. You will also gain experience in integrating new features into existing designs, considering how they impact the overall user experience.

### Tasks:

1. **Identify a User Engagement Opportunity**:

   - Review your user research and identify an area where users might benefit from additional engagement features.
   - Consider what would motivate users to return to the app regularly or deepen their meditation practice.

2. **Design the Feature**:

   - Sketch out ideas for the feature, considering its purpose, functionality, and how it integrates with the existing app design.
   - Create mid-fidelity wireframes of the feature in Figma, ensuring it aligns with the app’s overall design aesthetic.

3. **Test and Iterate**:

   - Conduct a brief usability test with at least 2-3 users to gather feedback on the new feature.
   - Make necessary refinements based on user feedback and update the wireframes.

4. **Document the Feature**:

   - Create a brief document or presentation that explains the feature, its purpose, and how it enhances user engagement. Include your wireframes and any key insights from the usability testing.

### Deliverables:

- Mid-fidelity wireframes of the custom feature
- Usability test results and refinements
- Feature documentation

### Tips:

- **Align with User Needs**: Ensure the feature directly addresses a need or desire expressed by users in your research.
- **Keep It Simple**: Focus on creating a feature that is easy to use and doesn’t complicate the user experience.
- **Test Early**: Get user feedback early in the design process to catch any issues or areas for improvement.
