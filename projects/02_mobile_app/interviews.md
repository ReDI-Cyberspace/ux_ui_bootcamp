# User Interviews 

The following one was the Research Objective: The objective of the research conducted by your previous colleague was to identify 3 people used to practise meditation and to explore their motivations, usage behaviours, preferences, and challenges, with a focus on their experiences with meditation apps or platforms.
This objective aimed to gather insights into the reasons why individuals who practise meditation are drawn to it, how they incorporate it into their lives, their preferences regarding meditation apps, as well as any obstacles they may encounter in maintaining a regular meditation practice. 
By understanding these factors, the research seeked to identify opportunities to develop new solutions that better meet users' needs and enhance their meditation experience.
These are the questions and the answers of the people interviewed:
