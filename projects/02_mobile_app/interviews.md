# User Interviews 

The following one was the Research Objective: The objective of the research conducted by your previous colleague was to identify 3 people used to practise meditation and to explore their motivations, usage behaviours, preferences, and challenges, with a focus on their experiences with meditation apps or platforms.

This objective aimed to gather insights into the reasons why individuals who practise meditation are drawn to it, how they incorporate it into their lives, their preferences regarding meditation apps, as well as any obstacles they may encounter in maintaining a regular meditation practice. By understanding these factors, the research seeked to identify opportunities to develop new solutions that better meet users' needs and enhance their meditation experience. These are the questions and the answers of the people interviewed:


## Person 1

_What initially sparked your interest in meditation?_

I was introduced to meditation during a particularly stressful period at work. A colleague suggested it as a way to cope with the stress and constant anxiety I was experiencing.

_Why do you meditate?_

My main reason for meditating is to manage stress and maintain a sense of calm throughout my hectic days. It has significantly improved my mood and my ability to handle stressful situations, though I do find it challenging to maintain as a regular habit.

_How do you currently incorporate meditation into your daily routine, if at all?_

I aim to meditate in the mornings. But let's be honest, I manage to fit in meditation sessions once or twice a week. Usually in the stressful times I meditate more often. In such times I really crave for calm moments and some peace. 

_Have you tried any meditation apps or platforms before?_

Yes, I've used several apps including Headspace, Calm, and Insight Timer. I currently stick with Insight Timer. Somehow I like it more than the others. 

_What was your experience with that app/platform?_

Hm. The Insight Timer app is okay. Some parts of it are not so intuitive and I get lost searching for a particular meditation. But overall, I like the app as it has many guided meditations. 

_Why did you choose that meditation app over another?_

I chose Insight Timer for its extensive library of guided sessions. And I really like the voice of the person who guides the meditation. I appreciate the calming voice of the person.

_How do you prefer to engage with guided meditation content?_

I prefer audio-guided sessions as they help me focus better by following the instructor's voice without visual distractions.

_What is your experience when trying to meditate regularly?_

I find maintaining a regular meditation practice quite challenging. I try to meditate in the morning. But you know, sometimes I go to bed too late and then I don't have the time in the morning to meditate. During stressful times, I do manage to meditate more often. I take some 10-15 minutes during the day to calm down. 


## Person 2

_What initially sparked your interest in meditation?_

I began exploring meditation while searching for ways to enhance my personal growth and handle everyday stress better. I was curious about its widely mentioned benefits for mindfulness and stress reduction.

_Why do you meditate?_

I find meditation crucial for managing stress and developing mindfulness. It improves my clarity and resilience in facing daily challenges. It's integral to my mental and emotional health. Additionally, meditation helps me develop greater self-awareness and mindfulness, enabling me to respond to life's challenges with more clarity and resilience. Overall, I see meditation as an essential tool for promoting my mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being.

_How do you currently incorporate meditation into your daily routine, if at all?_

I try to make meditation a daily habit by setting aside time each morning to practice. I find that starting my day with a short meditation session helps me feel more grounded and focused as I go about my tasks. I usually find a quiet spot in my home where I can sit comfortably and meditate for about 20-30 minutes before beginning my day.

_Have you tried any meditation apps or platforms before?_

Yes, I started with Calm and have never switched. To be honest, I don't know any other apps. But Calm was very easy to use. I have never meditated before. Calm made it easy to get started, also for me as a beginner. 

_What was your experience with that app/platform?_

Calm's app is very intuitive. I know where to find my favorite meditations. The quality of the guided meditations is very high. They now have some meditations with nature sounds. They are pretty amazing! 

_Why did you choose that meditation app over another?_

A friend recommended me Calm. I haven't tried any other app. But why should I? I am happy with the app.

_How do you prefer to engage with guided meditation content?_

I prefer audio sessions because listening to a soothing voice helps keep me focused and present, especially when my mind tends to wander.

_What is your experience when trying to meditate regularly?_

Usually I manage to meditate daily. I am pretty consistent with this habit. But there are days I find it challenging to quiet my mind and stay present, especially when I'm feeling stressed or overwhelmed.


## Person 3

_What initially sparked your interest in meditation?_

A friend recommended meditation to me as a tool for stress management during a particularly challenging phase in my life. At the time, I had a part-time job, I was searching for full time job, and participating in a UX/UI Bootcamp. I was looking for something that could help me handle stress and provide a mental break from my busy schedule.

_Why do you meditate?_

I've found meditation to be incredibly helpful for managing stress and anxiety. It offers me a peaceful break from the day's pressures and helps me refocus and regroup. Especially on days filled with back-to-back tasks and deadlines, a few minutes of meditation can significantly improve my mental clarity and overall emotional stability.

_How do you currently incorporate meditation into your daily routine, if at all?_

My meditation practice varies depending on my daily schedule, but I try to incorporate short sessions regularly. I typically meditate in the morning to start my day with a calm and centered mindset, or I find a quiet moment during my breaks to meditate for about 10 minutes. It's a flexible practice that I adjust based on my workload and stress levels.

_Have you tried any meditation apps or platforms before?_

Yes, I've recently started using Headspace. It's been a few weeks, and I find it suits my needs well as it accommodates my beginner skill level and fits into my hectic lifestyle.

_What was your experience with that app/platform?_

Headspace has been a great introduction to meditation for me. The app is user-friendly with a straightforward interface that makes navigating through the options quite easy. I particularly enjoy the free meditations available. The app also includes educational videos that explain the principles of meditation. The videos are very nice! You should see them.

_Why did you choose that meditation app over another?_

I chose Headspace as it offered a free version. The free content is limited but very good. It was easy to get started. Now I am thinking about buying the premium version. But it is 60â‚¬ per year. Not sure if I will buy it. Probably not. 

_How do you prefer to engage with guided meditation content?_

I like the audio meditations and the videos explaining the concepts. There are different voices you can choose from to guide the meditation. That is very cool! I found one person who has a very calm and relaxing voice. 

_What is your experience when trying to meditate regularly?_

I meditate when it fits into my day. I try to do it in the morning, but often it doesn't work. Sometimes I take 10-15 mninutes in a break to meditate. Overall, I've noticed a significant improvement in my ability to manage stress on days when I do meditate, which motivates me to continue incorporating it into my life as best as I can.
