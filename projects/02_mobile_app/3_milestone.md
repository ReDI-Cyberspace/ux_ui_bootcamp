# 3. Milestone - Prototyping, Testing and Refining

**What you do:** Students will first convert their mid-fidelity wireframes into clickable prototypes using Figma, following the user flows previously established. They can refer to Figma tutorials for assistance in prototyping. Next, students will engage in usability testing and refinement. They will decide on tasks to test, prepare test plans and scripts, and conduct three rounds of usability tests with different users, focusing on tasks related to online meditation. During the tests, they will take notes and prepare a Usability Analysis Report using Nielsen error metrics. After completing the tests, students will refine their mid-fidelity wireframes based on their findings and then create high-fidelity wireframes, incorporating elements like splash screens, onboarding flows, sign-up/login screens, profile areas, and features tested during usability analysis.
**What you learn:** Students will learn how to translate mid-fidelity wireframes into interactive prototypes using Figma, gaining proficiency in simulating user interactions and flows. Through usability testing, students will learn how to develop test plans, scripts, and conduct sessions to gather valuable feedback from users. They will also gain insights into analyzing usability data and prioritizing design improvements based on user feedback. Additionally, students will learn the importance of iterative design processes, refining their prototypes based on usability test results to enhance the overall user experience. Overall, milestone three equips students with practical skills in prototyping, usability testing, and iterative design, essential for creating user-centered digital products.

**Tips:**
- Keep the user at the center of your design process. Consider their needs, preferences, and pain points when creating prototypes and conducting usability testing.
- Clearly communicate your design ideas and concepts through prototypes
- Treat milestone three as an opportunity for continuous learning and improvement. Reflect on your experiences, learn from mistakes, and seek feedback from peers and instructors to enhance your prototyping and usability testing skills.
- UX Designers do not work alone. If possible, collaborate with peers to get feedback on your work. Different perspectives can help identify gaps or new insights.

**Deliverables:**
1. Clickable Prototype
2. Usability Testing and Refinement 

## Task 1 - Prototyping
Instructions:
1. Open the Figma file where you have your mid-fidelity wireframes. They should follow the user flow or the user flows that you have previously created. 
2. Turn your mid-fidelity wireframes into clickable prototypes. If you need help, you can rely on the Figma tutorial you have followed, here is the link to the prototyping chapter:
  - https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405337257751--Beginner-3-Build-prototypes
  - Here there are other two links, of which the last one uses a mid fidelity wireframe:

## Task 2 - Usability Testing and Refining
Instructions:
1. Scroll up until the “How to?” title and:
  - Decide the tasks to test
  - Prepare the test plan
  - Prepare the test script
2. You are not required to have a video call if you cannot have one. However, for the sake of your training, you should aim for it. In such cases, remember to obtain a signed consent form.
3. A Usability Test is conducted in 3 rounds, each one testing the task or the tasks, with 5 users all the time different. 
  - This means 15 people, and of course, all of them are within the right target, in this case, people who do meditation online.
  - At the end of each round, you would be then required to change your design according to your findings and start a new round.
  - As we are in a training setting and you have obvious limitations, we recommend you to do at least 1 round with at least 3 users. It is fine if they are target users, you are simply practising.
4. Take notes during the usability test session
5. Prepare the Usability Analysis Report and use the Nielsen error metrics Then you can organize your findings in this way:
  - Task: The number of the task you were testing (registration, changing meditation, selecting meditation etc) 
  - Observation: What the user said
  - Severity: The Nielsen value
  - Recommendation: How to solve the problem

6. If you have still doubt about how a Usability Testing kick off, here you have an example of a Usability Testing in person: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcfqmx2hnUQ
  - Here instead the example of a Usability Testing on the mobile app of Ryanair with also some pre-test question used to understand the interviewee and set the context: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O430PfvDkEA
7. Once you have completed the “Usability Test”, refine your Mid fidelity Wireframes (do not delete the previous version)
8. Now create the High Fidelity Wireframes including:
  - The splash screen
  - The onboarding flow
  - The Sign up - Login screen
  - Profile area
  - Effortless Exploration (the task/s you have picked from the data analysis, or in other terms the one you have usability tested.
