# 3. Milestone - Usability Test & Documentation

Your proposal is ready to go. At this milestone, you'll validate your proposal with a usability test, get feedback from users, and create documentation of your project to add to your portfolio.

**You will learn more about:** 

- `Usability Testing`
- `Documentation` of your project
- How to set up your `Portfolio`

**Deliverables:**

- Usability Test
- Documentation

## Task 1 - Run a Usability Test

It is important to validate our proposals, especially for products built from scratch. Plan your unmoderated usability tests to obtain user information that supports the design decisions you have made experimentally.

- Set up your [Usability Test Plan](https://redi-school-1.gitbook.io/ux-ui-bootcamp/2.-project-mobile-application/milestone-3-prototyping-testing-and-refining/usability-testing). What is your research objective? What is your target user profile? 
- Create a task guide for users in usability tests.
- Run the unmoderated usability test with at least 5 people (guerrilla or potential users).
- Identify error rates and other relevant design metrics in usability tests.
- Summarize your results, showing identified patterns, observations, and findings (if any).

**Deliverables:**

- Usability Test

## Task 2 - Document your Project in your Portfolio

You finished your Project. Congratulations! Now it is time to document your project and add it to your [UX design portfolio](https://redi-school-1.gitbook.io/ux-ui-bootcamp/4.-project-career/milestone-2-establish-online-presence/portfolio-step-by-step-guide). Include the following information:

  - **Clearly differentiate:** Indicate that it was a technical project without collaboration with a company.
  - **Design concept:** Explain the visual design concept and the technical principles underlying the design proposal.
  - **Visual elements:** Include sketches, diagrams, wireframes, screens, and other visual elements explaining the proposal.
  - **Validation results:** Present the results of user validation and what you consider still needs iteration.
  - **Personal learnings:** Share your personal learnings, both technical and life skills.

This documentation will be essential for your presentation at the end of the project. Don't worry about making it perfect; you will keep iterating on it throughout the bootcamp. 

**Deliverables:**

- Project Documentation in your Portfolio
