## Task 1 - Validation
Instructions:
It is vital to validate our proposals, especially with products built from scratch. Plan your unmoderated usability tests to obtain user information that supports the design decisions you made experimentally.

**Deliverables:**
- Usability Test

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Document detailing the research plan, including research objectives, target user profile, and sample size.
- Task guide for users in usability tests and evidence that these guides were validated with an external person (ideally a user).
- Unmoderated usability test with at least 5 people (guerrilla or potential users).
- Identify error rates and other relevant design metrics in usability tests.
- Synthesis of results, showing identified patterns, observations, and findings (if any).


## Task 2 - Documentation
Instructions:
During the bootcamp, you will develop projects to strengthen or build your UX design portfolio, so it's important to take the time to document each one as a case study from a technical perspective. 

**Deliverables:**
- Documentation 

Consider including the following information:
- Clearly differentiate that it was a technical project, without collaboration with the company.
- The visual design concept and the technical principles underpinning the design proposal.
- Sketches, diagrams, wireframes, screens, and other visual elements explaining the proposal.
- Results of user validation and what you consider still needs iteration.
- Your personal learnings, both technical and life skills.

This documentation will be essential for your presentation at the end of the project. Don't worry about making it perfect; you will keep iterating on it throughout the Bootcamp.
