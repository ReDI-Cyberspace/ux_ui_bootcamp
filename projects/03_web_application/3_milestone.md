# 3. Milestone - Usability Test & Documentation

Your proposal is ready to go. At this milestone, you'll validate your proposal with a usability test, get feedback from users, and create documentation of your project to add to your portfolio.

**You will learn more about:** 

- `Usability Testing`
- `Documentation` of your project
- How to set up your `Portfolio`

**Deliverables:**

- Usability Test
- Documentation

## Task 1 - Usability Test

It is important to validate our proposals, especially for products built from scratch. Plan your unmoderated usability tests to obtain user information that supports the design decisions you have made experimentally.

- Document detailing the research plan, including research objectives, target user profile, and sample size.
- Task guide for users in usability tests and evidence that these guides were validated by an external person (ideally a user).
- Unmoderated usability test with at least 5 people (guerrilla or potential users).
- Identify error rates and other relevant design metrics in usability tests.
- Synthesis of results, showing identified patterns, observations, and findings (if any).


**Deliverables:**

- Usability Test


## Task 2 - Documentation

During the bootcamp, you will develop projects to strengthen or build your UX design portfolio. It is important to take the time to document each project as a case study from a technical perspective. Consider including the following information:

  - **Clearly differentiate:** Indicate that it was a technical project without collaboration with a company.
  - **Design concept:** Explain the visual design concept and the technical principles underlying the design proposal.
  - **Visual elements:** Include sketches, diagrams, wireframes, screens, and other visual elements explaining the proposal.
  - **Validation results:** Present the results of user validation and what you consider still needs iteration.
  - **Personal learnings:** Share your personal learnings, both technical and life skills.

This documentation will be essential for your presentation at the end of the project. Don't worry about making it perfect; you will keep iterating on it throughout the bootcamp. 

**Deliverables:**

- Documentation
