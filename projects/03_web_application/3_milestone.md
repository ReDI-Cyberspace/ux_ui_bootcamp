## Task 1 - Validation
Instructions:
It is vital to validate our proposals, especially with products built from scratch. Plan your unmoderated usability tests to obtain user information that supports the design decisions you made experimentally.

**Deliverables:**
- Usability Test

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Document detailing the research plan, including research objectives, target user profile, and sample size.
- Task guide for users in usability tests and evidence that these guides were validated by an external person (ideally a user).
- Unmoderated usability test with at least 5 people (guerrilla or potential users).
- Identify error rates and other relevant design metrics in usability tests.
- Synthesis of results, showing identified patterns, observations, and findings (if any).


## Task 2 - Documentation
Instructions:
During the bootcamp, you will develop projects to strengthen or build your UX design portfolio. It is important to take the time to document each project as a case study from a technical perspective. Consider including the following information:

**Deliverables:**
- Documentation. Consider including the following information:
  - **Clearly differentiate:** Indicate that it was a technical project without collaboration with a company.
  - **Design concept:** Explain the visual design concept and the technical principles underlying the design proposal.
  - **Visual elements:** Include sketches, diagrams, wireframes, screens, and other visual elements explaining the proposal.
  - **Validation results:** Present the results of user validation and what you consider still needs iteration.
  - **Personal learnings:** Share your personal learnings, both technical and life skills.

This documentation will be essential for your presentation at the end of the project. Don't worry about making it perfect; you will keep iterating on it throughout the bootcamp.
