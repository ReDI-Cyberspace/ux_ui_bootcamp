# 1. Milestone - Planning, Competitor Analysis, Design Proposal

**What you do:**  You plan a design project from scratch, conduct a competitor analysis, and create the first design proposal.
**What you learn:** 
- `Competitor Analysis` by identifying key functionalities of the competitors
- `Project Scoping` by planning out your project from start to finish.
- Further advance your `information architecture` skills
- Creating a `Design Proposal`

##### Task 1: Planning
Getting organized when the business does not make a specific request can be very challenging, but it is still key to making the most of our time.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Summary of the overall scope of the project, detailing possible deliverables and a work plan listing tasks to be performed.
- Not all the time is necessary to invest the same effort in each stage of the design process. Use as a guide the OAs you want to strengthen during the project to define the time you will spend in each stage. For example, if you want to strengthen your prototyping and UI design skills, plan a brief analysis and a strong focus on visual exploration from the beginning.

##### Task 2: Competitor Analysis
How to understand the users of products that don't exist yet? By analyzing competitors' products or other tools they use to solve their needs.

**Deliverables:**
- Benchmark dashboard analysis, where you identify the key functionalities of this type of digital product.
- Desktop research on user pains in the category you have chosen.


##### Task 3: Design Proposal
You must propose a solution that can be designed in the project timeframe, ensuring that it solves the priority problems.

**Deliverables:**
- Design Proposal

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Multiple solution ideas and criteria for prioritizing them. Ideas can be phrases or pen and paper sketches that represent the solution.
- User flow diagrams and information architecture (categories, labels, navigation).
- Detail of how the proposal respects usability principles
- Basic voice and tone guide applied to the digital product
- Proposed text (micro-copy), icons and images
- Basic prototype* focusing on information architecture
*A basic prototype is one that can be navigated between screens and includes the most relevant content and functionalities without including visual details such as color, typography, etc.
