## 1. Introduction
Although they may seem invisible, the principles of visual design and UX design are the technical pillars that allow us to generate products of high aesthetic and functional value. In this project, we will focus on both the information architecture and the visual interface of a digital platform to delve into the more technical aspects that underpin our proposals.

## 2. Project Summary
Your mission will be to design a dashboard from scratch, starting with the hierarchy and information architecture (grouping, labels, navigation), the design of the proposed visual interface (layout, spacing, colors, typography, etc.) and finally validation with users.
In this project, we will break the design process into phases, starting with experimentation and including the users at the end. This is a very efficient way to perform people-centered design, but the key is to get as fast as possible to the validation phase and perform it rigorously.

General project objectives:
1. We want you to focus on learning extensively and working effectively
2. Implement all stages of the design process, adjusting activities according to the project context and available resources (time, etc.).
3. Design a digital proposal that contributes to solving the aforementioned challenges.

## 3. Learning Objective
- You define the scope and work plan at a general level, with detailed stages, deliverables, times, and activities
- You will learn how to generate design proposals from scratch when there is no initial product to improve, as well as how to use tools for non-modern usability testing
- Deepen in visual design principles, accessibility, usability, information architecture and user flows
- Design content and basic voice and tone guidelines that apply to UX content
- Document component library and reusable patterns using Atomic Design principles 

Keep an eyeðŸ‘€ on these life skills:
While life skills are always important, keep an eye on these particular life skills:
1. Effective Communication. Articulates and conveys questions, thoughts, and ideas clearly and facilitates dialogue (oral or written). Is eloquent and knows how to give and receive feedback.
2. Initiative. Monitors defines, prioritizes, and completes tasks without direct supervision. Participates actively by asking questions and providing feedback. Attempts to go beyond minimum job requirements. Is diligent, actively taking control and always tries to solve problems as they arise.
3. Self-starter. Is able to continuously acquire new knowledge and skills. Can monitor own learning needs and find the means to attempt and achieve autonomously. Learns from own mistakes.
4. Planning, organization, and time management. Is able to structure a "route" and identify dependencies and possible impediments. Is able to prioritize and organize his/her work in an adaptive way instead of trying to "predict".


## 4. Considerations
- Interviews and surveys are not allowed, so that you dare to experiment with the design process. The usability tests must be non-moderated.
- You recruit users for the tests. Try to make them potential users and ideally test with 5 people otherwise the results may be biased or insufficient.
- You should present your own solution, prototypes and tests. We know that some solutions will be similar since they solve the same challenge, but our way of thinking and solving is unique, dare to explore beyond the conventional.

## 5. Scope
To carry out the project, you will have to choose a digital product category since you will need reference platforms. Here, we give you some options but you will be able to propose others within the defined categories:
- Marketing: monitoring of relevant metrics for marketing. Some examples are [Semrush](https://www.semrush.com/), [Unbounce](https://unbounce.com/), and [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/).
- Sports and health: Applications focused on physical activity and health metrics. Examples: [Samsung Health](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sec.android.app.shealth&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1), [Flo health](https://flo.health/de), [Nike Training Club](https://www.nike.com/ntc-app)
- Finance: Personal finance or modern banking applications. Example: [N26](https://n26.com/de-de), [Splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com/)

## 6. Milestones & Acceptance Criteria
The project is divided into milestones, which are like kilometer markers on the road. You can decide how far you want to go. Completing the mandatory milestones is essential to consider the project completed; the bonus milestones are optional.

#### 1. Milestone: Planning, Analysis and Design Proposal (mandatory)  
You start the milestone with planning through your project. How to understand the users of products that don't exist yet? By analyzing competitors' products or other tools they use to solve their needs. Lastly, you start the design proposal.

**Deliverables:**
- Planning
- Competitor Analysis
- Design Proposal

**Milestone Detail: [1. Milestone](https://github.com/ReDI-School/ux_ui_bootcamp/blob/main/projects/03_web_application/1_milestone.md)**

#### 2. Milestone: Prototyping (mandatory)  
Once you have the structure of your proposal clear, it is time to integrate the visual elements necessary to enhance a good user experience.

**Deliverables:**
- Prototype

**Milestone Detail: [2. Milestone](https://github.com/ReDI-School/ux_ui_bootcamp/blob/main/projects/03_web_application/2_milestone.md)**
  

#### 3. Milestone - Usability Test & Documentation
It is vital to validate our proposals, especially with products built from scratch. Plan your unmoderated usability tests to obtain user information that supports the design decisions you made experimentally. Furthermore, in this milestone you set up a documentation of your project. It's important to take the time to document each one as a case study from a technical perspective. 

**Deliverables:**
- Usability Test
- Documentation 

**Milestone Detail: [3. Milestone](https://github.com/ReDI-School/ux_ui_bootcamp/blob/main/projects/03_web_application/3_milestone.md)**

#### 4. BONUS Milestone: Design Systems and Libraries
If you want to delve into component systematization, explore Material Design and use it in your proposal's construction.

**Deliverables:**
- Modify Material Design styles according to your design proposal (theme builder).
- Download and use the Material Design library for dashboards.

**Milestone Detail: [Bonus Milestone](https://github.com/ReDI-School/ux_ui_bootcamp/blob/main/projects/03_web_application/Bonus_milestone.md)**

Main questions:
After reading this information, here are some questions to think about before starting the project. In case you have any doubts, please bring them to the Q&A space we will have soon:
- What is the main difference from the previous project?
- What key skills will you be able to practice this time?
- Are you clear about the Learning Objectives of the project?
- Do you understand the content of each milestone?
- Are you curious about the project and what are you curious about?
- Take the opportunity to focus on areas that you feel are still challenging to maximize your learning experience and strengthen OAs that you have not been able to deepen previously. You count on our guidance throughout this process, but especially, on the talent and empathy of all your teammates to further enrich this learning community! ðŸ™ŒðŸ’›
