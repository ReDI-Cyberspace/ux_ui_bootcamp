![Dashboard Project](https://github.com/ReDI-School/ux_ui_bootcamp/assets/51905839/53453069-07a7-4050-a817-cad4181bba7b)


## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Dashboard Project, where we dive deep into the technical aspects of UX design, focusing on information architecture and visual interface design. Throughout this project, you'll engage with the core principles of visual design and UX to create a dashboard. Starting from the ground up, you will explore how to structure and design a digital platform's interface that meets user needs. This journey will cover everything from initial design to user testing, providing a comprehensive understanding of creating intuitive and impactful digital products.

## 2. Project Summary

Your mission will be to design a dashboard from scratch, starting with the hierarchy and information architecture (grouping, labels, navigation), designing the proposed visual interface (layout, spacing, colors, typography, etc.), and finally testing it with users. In this project, the design process is broken into phases, starting with experimentation and including the users at the end. This is a very efficient way to perform human-centered design, but the key is to get as fast as possible to the validation phase and perform it rigorously.

## 3. Learning Objective

- You will learn how to define the scope and work plan at a general level, with detailed stages, deliverables, times, and activities
- You will learn how to generate design proposals from scratch when there is no initial product to improve and how to use tools for non-moderated usability testing.
- You deepen your knowledge of visual design principles, accessibility, usability, information architecture, and user flows
- You will learn about design content and basic voice and tone guidelines that apply to UX content
- You will learn how to use the Document component library and reusable patterns with Atomic Design principles

## 4. Considerations

- **No interviews or surveys allowed:** The aim is to encourage you to undertake the design process experimentally. Usability tests should be unmoderated.
- **Recruit your own users:** You must recruit your own users for testing. Try to select potential users and ideally test with 5 people to avoid biased or insufficient results.
- **Present unique solutions:** You must present your own solution, prototypes, and tests. While some solutions may be similar as they address the same challenge, your way of thinking and solving problems is unique. Dare to explore beyond the conventional.

## 5. Scope

In this project, you choose a digital product you want to work on! You can choose between three categories of products (listed below). We listed a few products for each category that can serve you as reference platforms:

- **Marketing**: monitoring of relevant metrics for marketing. Some examples are [Semrush](https://www.semrush.com/), [Unbounce](https://unbounce.com/), and [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/).
- **Sports and health**: Applications focused on physical activity and health metrics. Examples: [Samsung Health](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sec.android.app.shealth&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1), [Flo health](https://flo.health/de), [Nike Training Club](https://www.nike.com/ntc-app)
- **Finance**: Personal finance or modern banking applications. Example: [N26](https://n26.com/de-de), [Splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com/)

## 6. Milestones

### 1. Milestone: Planning, Analysis, and Design Proposal

You start the project by choosing a product category from the three proposed areas above. Afterward, you work out a plan for your project describing the scope, the deliverables, and a detailed work plan. Afterward, you analyze the target product and its potential users by conducting a competitor analysis. You finish the first milestone by setting up your design proposal.

**Deliverables:**

- Project Plan
- Competitor Analysis
- Design Proposal

**Milestone Detail: [1. Milestone](https://github.com/ReDI-School/ux_ui_bootcamp/blob/main/projects/03_web_application/1_milestone.md)**

### 2. Milestone: Prototyping

Once you have defined the structure of your proposal, it is time to integrate the visual elements necessary to enhance the user experience.

**Deliverables:**

- Prototype

**Milestone Detail: [2. Milestone](https://github.com/ReDI-School/ux_ui_bootcamp/blob/main/projects/03_web_application/2_milestone.md)**
  

### 3. Milestone - Usability Test & Documentation

It is important to validate your proposal, especially when you design a product from scratch. That's why, in this third milestone, you perform an unmoderated usability test. The goal is to obtain information about the user interacting with your product that supports your design decisions. To finish your project and this milestone, you create a project documentation and add it to your Portfolio. It's important to take the time to document each one as a case study from a technical perspective. The goal is to capture the challenges you faced, the insights you gathered, your approach (high-level discussion guide, user selection criteria), and why you chose the approach. 

**Deliverables:**

- Usability Test
- Documentation 

**Milestone Detail: [3. Milestone](https://github.com/ReDI-School/ux_ui_bootcamp/blob/main/projects/03_web_application/3_milestone.md)**

### 4. BONUS Milestone: Design Systems and Libraries

The bonus milestone focuses on component systematization. You will explore material design and use it in your proposal. As always, this milestone is optional.

**Deliverables:**

- Modify Material Design styles according to your design proposal (theme builder).
- Download and use the Material Design library for dashboards.
