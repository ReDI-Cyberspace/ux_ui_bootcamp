## 1. Introduction
Although they may seem invisible, the principles of visual design and UX design are the technical pillars that allow us to generate products of high aesthetic and functional value. In this project, we will focus on both the information architecture and the visual interface of a digital platform to delve into the more technical aspects that underpin our proposals.

## 2. Project Summary
Your mission will be to design a dashboard from scratch, starting with the hierarchy and information architecture (grouping, labels, navigation), the design of the proposed visual interface (layout, spacing, colors, typography, etc.) and finally testing it with users.
In this project, we will break the design process into phases, starting with experimentation and including the users at the end. This is a very efficient way to perform human-centered design, but the key is to get as fast as possible to the validation phase and perform it rigorously.

## 3. Learning Objective
- You will learn how to define the scope and work plan at a general level, with detailed stages, deliverables, times, and activities
- You will learn how to generate design proposals from scratch when there is no initial product to improve, as well as how to use tools for non-modern usability testing
- You deepen your knowledge in visual design principles, accessibility, usability, information architecture, and user flows
- You will learn about design content and basic voice and tone guidelines that apply to UX content
- You will learn how to use the Document component library and reusable patterns with Atomic Design principles 

## 4. Considerations

- **No interviews or surveys allowed:** The aim is to encourage you to undertake the design process experimentally. Usability tests should be unmoderated.
- **Recruit your own users:** You must recruit your own users for testing. Try to select potential users and ideally test with 5 people to avoid biased or insufficient results.
- **Present unique solutions:** You must present your own solution, prototypes, and tests. While some solutions may be similar as they address the same challenge, your way of thinking and solving problems is unique. Dare to explore beyond the conventional.

## 5. Scope

To carry out the project, you will have to choose a digital product category since you will need reference platforms. Here, we give you some options, but you will be able to propose others within the defined categories:
- Marketing: monitoring of relevant metrics for marketing. Some examples are [Semrush](https://www.semrush.com/), [Unbounce](https://unbounce.com/), and [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/).
- Sports and health: Applications focused on physical activity and health metrics. Examples: [Samsung Health](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sec.android.app.shealth&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1), [Flo health](https://flo.health/de), [Nike Training Club](https://www.nike.com/ntc-app)
- Finance: Personal finance or modern banking applications. Example: [N26](https://n26.com/de-de), [Splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com/)

## 6. Milestones & Acceptance Criteria
The project is divided into milestones, which are like kilometer markers on the road. You can decide how far you want to go. Completing the mandatory milestones is essential to consider the project completed; the bonus milestones are optional.

### 1. Milestone: Planning, Analysis and Design Proposal (mandatory)  
The initial stage of the milestone is the planning phase, which entails an in-depth analysis of the target product and its intended users. This is a challenging aspect, as it requires an understanding of the needs of users of products that have yet to be conceived. One approach to addressing this challenge is through the analysis of competitors' products or other tools they utilize to address their needs. Following this, the design proposal is initiated.

**Deliverables:**
- Planning
- Competitor Analysis
- Design Proposal

**Milestone Detail: [1. Milestone](https://github.com/ReDI-School/ux_ui_bootcamp/blob/main/projects/03_web_application/1_milestone.md)**

### 2. Milestone: Prototyping (mandatory)  
Once you have the structure of your proposal clear, it is time to integrate the visual elements necessary to enhance a good user experience.

**Deliverables:**
- Prototype

**Milestone Detail: [2. Milestone](https://github.com/ReDI-School/ux_ui_bootcamp/blob/main/projects/03_web_application/2_milestone.md)**
  

### 3. Milestone - Usability Test & Documentation
It is vital to validate our proposals, especially with products built from scratch. Plan your unmoderated usability tests to obtain user information that supports the design decisions you made experimentally. Furthermore, in this milestone you set up a documentation of your project. It's important to take the time to document each one as a case study from a technical perspective. 

**Deliverables:**
- Usability Test
- Documentation 

**Milestone Detail: [3. Milestone](https://github.com/ReDI-School/ux_ui_bootcamp/blob/main/projects/03_web_application/3_milestone.md)**

### 4. BONUS Milestone: Design Systems and Libraries
The bonus milestone focuses on component systematization. You will explore Material Design and use it in your proposal's construction.

**Deliverables:**
- Modify Material Design styles according to your design proposal (theme builder).
- Download and use the Material Design library for dashboards.
