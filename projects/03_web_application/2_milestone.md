# 2. Milestone - Prototyping

**What you do:** In this milestone you prototype your proposal. You create a moodboard and a high fidelty prototype. 
**What you learn:** 
- `Moodboard`
- `Component library` built under Atomic Design principles
- `High-fidelity` prototyping

## Task 1 - Prototyping

Once you have the structure of your proposal clear, it is time to integrate the visual elements necessary to enhance a good user experience.

**Deliverables:**
- Moodboard with visual references that work as inspiration for your UI.
- Visual guide with specifications of the graphic elements: color palette, fonts, layout, and spacing between elements (internal margins: padding / external margins: margin).
- A high-fidelity navigable prototype with basic interactions (change screen, back, etc.). It must include a web version and a mobile or tablet version.
- Explanation where you demonstrate how you applied the basic principles of accessibility in your proposal (perceptibility and operability).
- Component library (UI Kit) built under Atomic Design principles.
