# 2. Milestone - Design & Prototyping

You've got your design proposal ready to go. In this milestone, you'll prototype your proposal by creating a mood board and a high-fidelity prototype.

**You will learn more about:** 

- [Moodboard](https://redi-school-1.gitbook.io/ux-ui-bootcamp/3.-project-dashboard/milestone-2-prototyping/mood-board)
- `Component library` built under Atomic Design principles
- `High-fidelity` [prototyping](https://redi-school-1.gitbook.io/ux-ui-bootcamp/3.-project-dashboard/milestone-2-prototyping)

## Task 1 - Design

Once you have the structure of your proposal clear, it is time to integrate the visual elements necessary to enhance a good user experience.

**Deliverables:**

- [Moodboard]((https://redi-school-1.gitbook.io/ux-ui-bootcamp/3.-project-dashboard/milestone-2-prototyping/mood-board)) with visual references that work as inspiration for your UI.
- Visual guide with specifications of the graphic elements: color palette, fonts, layout, and spacing between elements (internal margins: padding / external margins: margin).



## Task 2 - Prototyping

- A high-fidelity navigable [prototype](https://redi-school-1.gitbook.io/ux-ui-bootcamp/2.-project-mobile-application/milestone-3-prototyping-testing-and-refining/prototyping/type-of-prototypes) with basic interactions (change screen, back, etc.). It must include a web version and a mobile or tablet version.
- Explanation where you demonstrate how you applied the basic principles of accessibility in your proposal (perceptibility and operability).
- Component library (UI Kit) built under Atomic Design principles.
