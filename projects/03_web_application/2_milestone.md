# 2. Milestone - Prototyping

## Task 1 - Prototyping

Once you have the structure of your proposal clear, it is time to integrate the visual elements necessary to enhance a good user experience.

**Deliverables:**
- Moodboard with visual references that work as inspiration for your UI.
- Visual guide with specifications of the graphic elements: color palette, fonts, layout, and spacing between elements (internal margins: padding / external margins: margin).
- High fidelity navigable prototype with basic interactions (change screen, back, etc.). It must include a web version and a mobile or tablet version.
- Explanation where you demonstrate how you applied the basic principles of accessibility in your proposal (perceptibility and operability).
- Component library (UI Kit) built under Atomic Design principles.
