## 1. Introduction
Although they may seem invisible, the principles of visual design and UX design are the technical pillars that allow us to generate products of high aesthetic and functional value. In this project we will focus on both the information architecture and the visual interface of a digital platform, to delve into the more technical aspects that underpin our proposals.

## 2. Project Summary
Your mission will be to design a dashboard from scratch, starting with the hierarchy and information architecture (grouping, labels, navigation), the design of the proposed visual interface (layout, spacing, colors, typography, etc.) and finally validation with users.
In this project, we will break the design process into phases, starting with experimentation and including the users at the end. This is a very efficient way to perform people-centered design, but the key is to get as fast as possible to the validation phase and perform it rigorously.


General project objectives:
1. We want you to focus on learning extensively and working effectively
2. Implement all stages of the design process, adjusting activities according to the project context and available resources (time, etc.).
3. Design a digital proposal that contributes to solving the aforementioned challenges.

## 3. Milestones & Acceptance Criteria
To carry out the project, you will have to choose a digital product category since you will need reference platforms. Here, we give you some options but you will be able to propose others within the defined categories:
- Marketing: monitoring of relevant metrics for marketing. Some examples are Semrush, Unbounce, and Mixpanel.
- Sports and health: Applications focused on physical activity and health metrics. Examples: Samsung Health, Flo health, Nike Training Club
- Finance: Personal finance or modern banking applications. Example: Splitwise, iSaveMoney, Nequi
The project is divided into milestones, which are like kilometer markers on the road. You decide how far you want to go, and your decision will depend on the time you have available each day, your learning pace, and the depth you want to reach.
Completing the mandatory milestones is essential to consider the project completed; the other milestones are optional, as they are to deepen or explore other skills.
During the different milestones, or at the close of the project, you must present documentation that demonstrates what you did in a tangible way and in compliance with the acceptance criteria, which exist so that you can self-validate if you really achieved the desired result.

#### 1. Milestone: Project and Analysis (mandatory)

##### 1. Part: Project
Getting organized when the business does not make a specific request can be very challenging, but it is still key to making the most of our time.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Summary of the overall scope of the project, detailing possible deliverables and a work plan listing tasks to be performed.
- Not all the time is necessary to invest the same effort in each stage of the design process. Use as a guide the OAs you want to strengthen during the project to define the time you will spend in each stage. For example, if you want to strengthen your prototyping and UI design skills, plan a brief analysis and a strong focus on visual exploration from the beginning.

##### 2. Part: Analysis of existing
How to understand the users of products that don't exist yet? By analyzing competitors' products or other tools they use to solve their needs.

Acceptance criteria:
- Benchmark dashboard analysis, where you identify the key functionalities of this type of digital product.
- Desktop research on user pains of the category you have chosen.
  
#### 2. Milestone: Design proposal (mandatory)
You must propose a solution that can be designed in the project timeframe, ensuring that it solves the priority problems.

Acceptance criteria:
- Multiple solution ideas and criteria for prioritizing them. Ideas can be phrases or pen and paper sketches that represent the solution.
- User flow diagrams and information architecture (categories, labels, navigation).
- Detail of how the proposal respects usability principles
- Basic voice and tone guide applied to the digital product
- Proposed text (micro-copy), icons and images
- Basic prototype* focusing on information architecture
*A basic prototype is one that can be navigated between screens and includes the most relevant content and functionalities, without including visual details such as color, typography, etc.
  
#### 3. Milestone: Prototyping (mandatory)
Once you have the structure of your proposal clear, it is time to integrate the visual elements necessary to enhance a good user experience.

Acceptance criteria:
- Moodboard with visual references that work as inspiration for your UI.
- Visual guide with specifications of the graphic elements: color palette, fonts, layout, and spacing between elements (internal margins: padding / external margins: margin).
- High fidelity navigable prototype with basic interactions (change screen, back, etc.). It must include a web version and a mobile or tablet version.
- Explanation where you demonstrate how you applied the basic principles of accessibility in your proposal (perceptibility and operability).
- Component library (UI Kit) built under Atomic Design principles.


#### 4. Milestone: Validation (BONUS)
It is vital that we validate our proposals, especially with products built from scratch. To do this, you need to plan your non-moderated usability tests so that you get user feedback to support the design decisions you made experimentally.

Acceptance criteria:
- Document detailing the research plan, including research objectives, target user profile, and sample size.
- Guideline of tasks to be performed by users in usability testing and evidence that you validated these guidelines with a person outside the team (ideally a user).
- Non-moderated usability testing with at least 5 people (guerrilla or potential users)
- Identify error rates and other relevant design metrics in usability testing.
- Synthesis of results, showing identified patterns, observations, and findings (if any).

In this project, this will be the time when you involve users directly. Make sure you follow the best practices for usability testing.

## 4. Further Explanation
- Interviews and surveys are not allowed, so that you dare to experiment with the design process. The usability tests must be non-moderated.
- You recruit users for the tests. Try to make them potential users and ideally test with 5 people, otherwise the results may be biased or insufficient.
- You should present your own solution, prototypes and tests. We know that some solutions will be similar since they solve the same challenge, but our way of thinking and solving is unique, dare to explore beyond the conventional.

## 5. Learning Objective
- Being a short project, it is key to define the scope and work plan at a general level, with detailed stages, deliverables, times and activities.
- You will learn how to generate design proposals from scratch, when there is no initial product to improve, as well as how to use tools for non-modern usability testing.
- Deepen in visual design principles, accessibility, usability, information architecture and user flows.
- Design content and basic voice and tone guidelines that apply to UX content
- Document component library and reusable patterns, using Atomic Design principles 

Life Skills
Keep an eyeðŸ‘€ on these life skills:
1. Effective Communication. Articulates and conveys questions, thoughts, and ideas clearly and facilitates dialogue (oral or written). Is eloquent and knows how to give and receive feedback.
2. Initiative. Monitors defines, prioritizes, and completes tasks without direct supervision. Participates actively by asking questions and providing feedback. Attempts to go beyond minimum job requirements. Is diligent, actively taking control and always tries to solve problems as they arise.
3. Self-starter. Is able to continuously acquire new knowledge and skills. Can monitor own learning needs and find the means to attempt and achieve autonomously. Learns from own mistakes.
4. Planning, organization, and time management. Is able to structure a "route" and identify dependencies and possible impediments. Is able to prioritize and organize his/her work in an adaptive way instead of trying to "predict".

## 6. Hints, tips, and further readings
During the project's development, the coaches will share information via Slack and in synchronous spaces as needed. Feel free to supplement with resources you research on your own and share them with all ðŸ¤“.
