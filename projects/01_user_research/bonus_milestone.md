# Bonus Milestone - Conduct a Competitive Analysis

> Bonus Milestones are optional. They are an extra challenge if you are finished and satisfied with the previous milestones of your project. 

### What you will do:

In this bonus milestone, you will expand your research by conducting a competitive analysis. This involves identifying and analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of competitors' products or services that are similar to the area you are researching. You will look at competitors' user experiences, features, design choices, and customer feedback to gain insights that can inform your own design decisions.

### You will learn more about:

You will develop skills in evaluating competitor products, understanding market trends, and identifying gaps or opportunities that can be leveraged in your design. This milestone will help you understand how to position your design solution effectively within the competitive landscape.

### Tasks:

1. **Identify Competitors**:

   - List 3-5 direct or indirect competitors whose products or services are relevant to your research focus.
  
2. **Conduct Analysis**:

   - Analyze the user experience of each competitor, focusing on key aspects like usability, aesthetics, and functionality.
   - Identify what works well and what doesn't in their designs.
  
3. **Gather User Feedback**:

   - Look for customer reviews or feedback on these competitors' products to understand user sentiment and pain points.

4. **Summarize Findings**:

   - Compile your findings into a short report that highlights key insights and how they can inform your design decisions.

### Deliverables:

- A Competitive Analysis Report that includes:
  - A list of competitors
  - Key strengths and weaknesses of their products/services
  - Opportunities and gaps identified from the analysis
  - Recommendations on how to apply these insights to your project

### Tips:

- **Focus on User Experience**: Pay close attention to how users interact with competitor products. What makes the experience good or bad?
- **Look for Trends**: Identify any common trends or patterns across competitors that might indicate broader user expectations or industry standards.
- **Think Strategically**: Use your findings to differentiate your design and offer unique value to your users.
