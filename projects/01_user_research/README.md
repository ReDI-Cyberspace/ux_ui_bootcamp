# Introduction
This project will cover essential steps such as crafting a research plan, conducting user interviews, and translating findings into actionable design insights. This project emphasizes the significance of understanding user behaviors and needs, analyzing data, developing detailed user personas, and mapping out user journeys to guide design decisions effectively. 
By systematically approaching these stages, students will gain hands-on experience in shaping a human-centered design strategy that informs and enhances the overall user experience.

# Project Summary
The key element of this project is the number of people you can interview. The more people you reach out to, the more data you can collect and, consequently, the more practical experience you'll gain. 

Interviews, while valuable, can be challenging because they require people to speak openly. As a result, interviews typically last between 30 to 45 minutes, and it’s not always guaranteed that you’ll get all the information you need.
Therefore, it would be ineffective to assign a specific research focus to a particular sector, product, or service if you don’t have enough people in your network to interview. Instead, since this is exploratory research, it’s essential to consider where the largest concentration of contacts within your network is located.
For example, if you have many friends who are musicians, athletes, travelers, or users of a specific application, focus on these groups. 

If you have a lot of friends who travel frequently, you might explore their experiences related to travel, such as interactions with airports, transportation, or travel-related apps.
In summary, choose a research topic that reflects your network and their direct experiences. 

This approach ensures that your research is grounded in real-world contexts and maximizes the relevance of your findings.

1. Study all the lessons of this project before starting the project. 
You must have cleared the whole picture before initiating the qualitative research. This is because you will be required to create user personas and a user journey map, and the questions you plan to ask will need to be tailored to grant you as much data as possible in order to create these two artifacts.

2. Create a Comprehensive Research Plan
Develop a research plan to understand user needs and preferences for the target of your research. 

3. Conduct User Interviews and Analyze Data
Perform user interviews to gather qualitative insights, then transcribe, code, and analyze the data to uncover key themes and user needs.
You should interview at least 3 people and have around 6-10 questions, follow-up excluded, for each person interviewed.

4. Develop User Personas and Journey Maps
Based on the qualitative data, create detailed user personas that represent your audience. Additionally, craft a user journey map to visualize the user experience, highlighting pain points and opportunities.


# Milestones

## 1. Milestone - Research Plan
What you will do: Students will outline their research objectives, methods (user interview), participant recruitment strategy, and timeline. This involves understanding the context of the project, identifying what information is needed, and determining the best methods to gather this information. Students will also plan how to recruit participants who fit the target audience criteria and develop a timeline to ensure the research is completed.
What you learn: Students will develop skills in planning and organizing research activities, which are pivotal for gathering reliable and relevant data. They will learn how to set clear research objectives that align with the project goals and create a structured approach to participant recruitment. Additionally, students will gain experience in creating a detailed timeline to manage their research process effectively.
Tips:
Clearly define your research objectives to ensure your efforts are focused and relevant.
As already said, and because it’s a practice environment, select the research objective based on the type of user segment you can reach within your network.
Create a realistic timeline, allowing enough time for each stage of the research process.

## 2. Milestone - Conducting and Analysing User Interviews
What you do: Students will recruit participants, conduct 3-5 user interviews, transcribe and code the data, and identify key themes and insights. 
This involves preparing interview scripts, obtaining consent from participants, and using various tools and techniques to analyze the data collected. Students will look for patterns and themes that reveal user behaviors, attitudes, needs, and pain points.
What you learn: Students will develop skills in qualitative research, including conducting interviews and analyzing qualitative data. Through data transcription and coding, students will gain experience in identifying and categorizing key themes and insights, which are essential for understanding user needs and behaviors.
Tips: Prepare thoroughly for interviews by creating a detailed script and obtaining all necessary consent forms.
Use a tool that allows you to record an audio or video call so that you will not need to write the user's answer between questions.
Build rapport with participants to encourage open and honest responses.
Transcribe interviews accurately and organize your data systematically. You can use video transcription or audio transcription, which is available for free online.
Look for patterns and recurring themes to gain deeper insights into user behaviors and needs.


## 3. Milestone - Creating User Personas and User Journey Map
What you do: Based on the interview data analysis, students will develop user personas representing different segments of their target audience. They will also create a user journey map to visualize the user’s experience and identify pain points and opportunities. This involves synthesizing the data into detailed profiles and mapping out the steps users take to achieve their goals, highlighting areas where the user experience can be improved.
What you learn: Students will learn how to translate qualitative data into actionable insights by creating user personas and journey maps. They will gain skills in synthesizing data to create representative user-profiles and visualizing user experiences to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement.
Tips: Use the insights gained from user interviews to create detailed and realistic personas; data must be actionable and influence design.
Ensure your personas cover a range of user segments to capture diverse perspectives.
Map out the user journey comprehensively, including all steps, touchpoints, and emotions.
Look for opportunities to improve the user experience by addressing pain points and enhancing positive moments.
