# Milestone 1 - Research Plan

**What you will do:** Students will outline their research objectives, methods (user interview), participant recruitment strategy, and timeline. This involves understanding the context of the project, identifying what information is needed, and determining the best methods to gather this information. Students will also plan how to recruit participants who fit the target audience criteria and develop a timeline to ensure the research is completed.

**What you learn:** Students will develop skills in planning and organizing research activities, which are pivotal for gathering reliable and relevant data. They will learn how to set clear research objectives that align with the project goals, and create a structured approach to participant recruitment. Additionally, students will gain experience in creating a detailed timeline to manage their research process effectively.

**Tips:**
- Clearly define your research objectives to ensure your efforts are focused and relevant.
- As already said and because itâ€™s a practice environment, select the research objective based on the type of user segment you can reach within your network.
- Create a realistic timeline, allowing enough time for each stage of the research process.
